# dotfiles

NOTES:

  - `_home_/.config/nvim` for now rely on LazyVim being installed and only
    contains my own supplementary files, not the full config LazyVim installs.

    `_home_/.config/nvim.back` is a different neovim config that does not rely
    on LazyVim.

  - Many dotfiles may be out-of-date, I distro-hopped, wm-hopped, editor-hopped
    and tools-hopped a lot.
